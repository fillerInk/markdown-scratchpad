### How Generative Adversarial Networks works 

Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs as they are popularly called are one of the most groundbreaking developments in deep
learning in the past few years. Unlike other neural networks which can predict values from data, GANs are designed to come up 
with their own data. The consequences of such an algorithm are far reaching as GANs today have even been trained to generate 
images of new human faces, based on
